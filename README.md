# Learning a low dimensional manifold of real cancer tissue with Pathology-GAN

**Abstract:**

*This paper builds upon the recently introduced PathologyGAN, which successfully recreates cancer tissue images. PathologyGAN provides a low dimensional latent space that shows ordering based on high level features of tissue (e.g. cancer cell, lymphocyte, and stromal density). We improve PathologyGAN by adding an encoder that is trained simultaneously. This is important because not only can our model generate high fidelity tissue, it can also project real tissue samples onto the GANâ€™s latent space.We study the latent space using real tissue samples and show that it holds tissue morphological characteristics (e.g. cancer, lymphocytes, or stromal cells). We test our modified PathologyGAN using real H&E breast cancer tissue samples from patients of two clinical cohorts (VGH and NKI). In these cases, we show that different densities of high level features of cancer tissue are associated with patient survival.*
